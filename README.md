# Student Management Application

## Overview

The Student Management Application is a console-based program designed to manage student records efficiently. It allows users to capture new student details, search for students by ID, delete student records, and generate reports of all student records. The application provides a simple menu-driven interface for ease of use.

## Features

- **Capture Student Details**: Add new student records with unique IDs, names, ages, emails, and courses.
- **Search for Students**: Retrieve student information using their unique IDs.
- **Delete Student Records**: Remove student records after confirming the deletion.
- **Generate Reports**: Print a report listing all students with their details.
- **Age Validation**: Ensure that the entered age meets the required minimum (16 years).

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

The application consists of three main classes:

1. **Student**: Represents a student record and provides methods for saving, searching, deleting, and reporting on student records.
2. **StudentManagementApplication**: Contains the main method and handles user interactions via a console interface.
3. **StudentTest**: Contains unit tests for the `Student` class, ensuring that all methods work correctly.
